# Enumerate
Target enumeration for first contact


Developed during my OSCP training (see https://www.offensive-security.com/), this script is intended
for first enumeration of a new target.

enumerate.sh <target-ip>

1) It is intendeded for just one ip, not a range (i.e. invoke multiple time if necessay)
2) It does what I need it to, feel free to add, comment, suggest.
3) It was intended to be bash only, with just tools from kali.
4) Individual enumeration modules can be run with the -m flag (see help)


Enjoy,
